                    <p>In the evolving world, AI has become a valuable tool that
                        aids us in our mission at MoKa Reads to provide
                        high-quality, informative, and engaging content to our
                        readers.
                    </p>

                    <p>Some of the content on MoKa Reads has been generated with
                        the assistance of advanced generative artificial
                        intelligence (AI) algorithms. These AI systems are
                        trained on vast datasets of human-written text and are
                        designed to mimic human language. While content is
                        generated algorithmically and without direct human
                        input, we want to assure you that we take careful steps
                        to ensure its accuracy and relevance.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our team at MoKa Reads meticulously reviews all
                        AI-generated content and makes the necessary
                        modifications to meet our quality standards. Our goal is
                        to provide you with valuable information in a readable
                        and engaging format.
                    </p>
                    <p>We believe that AI enhances our ability to deliver
                        content, and we value transparency in this process. This
                        disclosure is meant to inform our readers about the AI's
                        role in content creation.
