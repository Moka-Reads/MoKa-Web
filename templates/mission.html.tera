            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>At MoKa Reads, our mission is to provide accessible and high-quality education to everyone, making
                learning new skills and technologies a delightful experience. We believe in the power of open-source
                education and its potential to transform lives. By embracing open-source principles, we can
                contribute to and benefit from the collective knowledge of the community, fostering innovation and
                growth.</p>
            <p>We draw inspiration from the late Aaron Swartz, a visionary technologist, and open access activist.
                Aaron's passionate advocacy for making knowledge available to all has had a profound impact on the
                world of information sharing and open education. His dedication to open access and information
                freedom continues to fuel our mission at MoKa Reads.</p>
            <p>Education is not meant to be confined; it should be preserved and open, with the doors wide open for
                exploration and learning. At MoKa Reads, we envision a future where education knows no boundaries,
                where knowledge is accessible to learners from all walks of life, empowering them to pursue their
                passions and reach their full potential.</p>
            <p>We believe that building a vibrant community and fostering collaboration can make a tremendous impact
                on innovation and positively transform people's lives. MoKa Reads is more than just an educational
                platform; it is a collaborative space where learners from diverse backgrounds can come together,
                share their knowledge, and empower others to grow.</p>
            <p>Open education, to us, is not just about access to resources; it's about the spirit of sharing,
                connecting, and empowering one another. Through MoKa Reads, we aspire to open doors to a world of
                knowledge, where learners can explore new horizons, expand their skillsets, and embark on a journey
                of continuous growth and self-discovery.</p>
            <p class="mission-meaning"><strong>MKR:</strong> MKR stands for "Mustafif Khan Reference Library." MKR
                is a tribute to my first programming project, which aimed to centralize STEM materials for students.
                The MKR project was built on the principles of openness and sharing knowledge, which now serve as
                the foundation for MoKa Reads.</p>
            <p class="mission-meaning">As an avid espresso enthusiast, I also find inspiration in my favorite
                espresso drink, the Mocha. Just like the harmonious blend of coffee and chocolate in a Mocha, MoKa
                Reads aims to blend the joy of learning with the rich flavors of knowledge.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Hello there; it's a pleasure to introduce myself to you. My name is Mustafif Khan, and I am the
                    founder of MoKa Reads, of which I am extremely proud. I was initially drawn to programming due
                    to my
                    fascination with web development. However, as time has passed, my interest has evolved, and I
                    have
                    expanded my knowledge to include systems programming. I am excited about the challenges
                    presented by
                    Rust, C, C++, and Zig.</p>

                <p>I am passionate about creating efficient and elegant code, which has culminated in the
                    publication
                    of my latest book, "Rust for C++ Programmers." This book is designed to bridge the gap between
                    two
                    powerful programming languages and introduce fellow programmers to Rust's unique capabilities
                    and
                    paradigms.</p>

                <p>I firmly believe that education can transform lives and foster innovation. As an independent
                    publisher and author based in Canada, I am delighted to be working on MoKa Reads. This
                    open-source
                    education platform enables me to share my knowledge and expertise with a broad audience.</p>

                <p>My pursuits in both programming and poetry allow me to explore the complexities of life and human
                    experiences. I hope my work will inspire others to embark on their own journeys of
                    self-discovery
                    and growth. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better.</p>
