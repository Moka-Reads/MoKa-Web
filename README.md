# MoKa Reads Web 

This is the web application for the MoKa Reads project. This is built using the [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) web framework and 
uses the [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app/) template engine. The web application is built to provide a way for users to 
interact with the MoKa Reads project. This includes the ability to view articles, cheat sheets, and resources. Keeping the 
website opensource allows for users to contribute fixes and improvements to the website that may occur during 
their use of the website.
